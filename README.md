# Rules/Terms/FAQ
- A Hunt is a set of packages
- First to find gets the "Mayor" status for life. A Mayor can add a text tagline to the loot.
- The most recent person to find is the owner until someone else finds it. An Owner can add/edit a hint and add an image.
- A person can be the Mayor and Owner at the same time.
- The lottery can give you points if the lottery is available and you guess the right package in the UI.
- Trophy is a concept for most points awarded at the expiration of a hunt.

# Setup
- Install php packages
- Look through the repo for anywhere that says "CHANGE ME"
- Double check app/conf.php for things that need to be changed. Setup the environment etc. It uses the current directory.
- Go easy on me ðŸ˜­ I made this in a crunch to try and be online/working in time for a convention. The hunt went well and I learned a lot.

It's been a while since the domain was live but I still really enjoyed this project and want to share the code. I would love to have it working again some day with the plan to roll out local Hunts in populated areas like universities where cards would be hidden around campus etc.
